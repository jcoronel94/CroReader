# CroReader
CroReader is an open source ABIF file tool that visualizes and processes trace data with automated high-confidence region extraction and file format conversion.

## Purpose
Although Next generation Sequencing technologies have been adopted in biomedical and life science fields, Sanger Capillary Sequencing methods are still widely used. Unfortunately, developers have shifted their attention on creating NGS tools and have decreased creation and maintenance of tools compatible with ABIF files. The goal of CroReader is to provide an up to date bioinformatic tool compatible with ABIF files with algorithms capable of dectecting and extracting high quality regions in either FASTA or FASTQ format with the addional option of batch processing.
