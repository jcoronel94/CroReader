# CroReader
# General Information for `CroReader`
## Explanation:
Current project allows user to open up multiple chromatograms and view. Chromatograms can be switched between and display can be zoomed in or out. There is also an option to export the current chromatogram as a PDF file. Currently we are working on completing a peak finder that is capable of filtering out false positives and that is more effective than current closed source alternatives such as 4peaks and finchTV   

## Important To Do: to check whether all the jar libaries in the lib folder can be redistributed, if yes, what license info we need to display, if not, provide the source link instead of the jar directly.
