# How to use

In the distro folder there are some sample files that can be opened on CroReader. 

Opening files (Folder Icon / open under file menu / Alt + N):
Only one file can be opened at a time. Opening a new file while one is open will add a new tab to the window. 

Closing files (Trash Icon/ close under file menu / Ctrl + w): 
Closes the active tab. Only one tab may be closed at a time. 

Exporting PDF of chromatogram (arrow icon / export under file menu):
Export current active chromatogram as a PDF to local machine. 

There are multiple ways to change the look of the active chromatogram. Under the view menu 'base position numbers', 'base call', and 'quality score' can be toggled off to remove additional information located at the top of the chromatogram. 'Toggle bad region window' will highlight the default guess at the bad regions in the chromatogram. Reverse complement will reverse the order of base calls and change the nucleotide called to it's complement. The nucleotide button tab on the top right corner of the window will change the color of the corresponding nucleotide trace.  

Go to base will slide the window to the searched base number, if it exists. Find sequence will search for all matching strings in the sequence and slide the window to the beginning of the found string. Pressing search again will bring the window to the next match in the cylce. 

Under the process menu 'output current file region' will output a FASTA or FASTQ file with the extracted high quality region for the current active chromatogram. 'Batch file regions' allows for multiple files to be processed sequentially and outputted in a single FASTA or FASTQ file. CroReader does not require any active chromatograms to use the 'Batch file regions' option.
